#include <stdio.h>

// We include both course.h and student.h headers because let's say we want to 
// work with both Students and Courses.  This would be a natural thing for a 
// programmer to do.  The issue is that course.h includes student.h already, so
// if we include student.h here too, without using include guards, the Student
// struct type will be declared twice and a compiler error will occur. 
//
// Using include guards prevents this from occurring.

#include "course.h"
#include "student.h"
